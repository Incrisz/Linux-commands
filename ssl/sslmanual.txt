#openssl version


1.Create a private key: Run the following command to generate a private key in the PEM format:

#openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -aes256

a.Enter PEM pass phrase: 1ncrease

This command generates an encrypted private key in the private_key.pem file.

2.Create a certificate signing request (CSR): Run the following command to generate a CSR:

#openssl req -new -key private_key.pem -out csr.pem

This command generates a CSR in the csr.pem file. You'll need to fill in some information about your website or organization, such as the common name (CN), which is usually the domain name.

3.Create a self-signed certificate: Run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate:

#openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.pem -signkey private_key.pem -out certificate.pem

This command generates a self-signed certificate in the certificate.pem file, which is valid for one year (365 days).

4.Install the certificate: Install the certificate and private key in your web server's configuration. The exact steps to do this depend on your web server and operating system.
